### Step 2:
Once the repository is cloned, the necessary packages to run the website from Atom need be installed.

To reach the packages option go to ***File->Settings->Packages***

The first package to be installed is "emmet".

![Guide6](readme_imgs/6.png)

The second package to be installed is "atom-live-server". If this package does not appear, it can also be found at [https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server](https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server).

### Step 3:
Once those two packages are installed you are ready to view the code.
Open the index.html file and click on the Packages tab, atom-live-server, start server
***Packages->atom-live-server->Start server***
